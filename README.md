# VPN Privacy and Secure Communication Report

## Objective
Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and enabling secure communication.

## Tools Used
- **VPN Service:** ProtonVPN (Free Tier)
- **Other Tools:** whatismyipaddress.com for IP verification

## Steps Performed
1. **Chose VPN Service:** Signed up for ProtonVPN (free tier).
2. **Downloaded & Installed Client:** Installed ProtonVPN desktop application.
3. **Connected to VPN Server:** Selected the closest available server for better speed.
4. **Verified IP Change:** Used whatismyipaddress.com to confirm IP address change after connection.
5. **Tested Traffic Encryption:** Observed encrypted traffic through network monitoring.
6. **Changed VPN Server:** Switched to another server to confirm IP address change functionality.
7. **Disconnected & Compared:** Compared browsing speed and IP before and after VPN connection.
8. **Researched Encryption & Privacy:** Learned about VPN encryption protocols like OpenVPN and IKEv2, and their benefits for privacy.

## Key Observations
- **Before VPN:** IP address exposed, traffic unencrypted.
- **After VPN:** IP address masked, traffic encrypted.
- **Server Switching:** Successfully changed IP by switching VPN servers.
- **Performance Impact:** Slight decrease in speed after VPN connection.

## Benefits of VPN
- Masks real IP address and location.
- Encrypts internet traffic to prevent eavesdropping.
- Allows bypassing geographic restrictions.
- Provides additional layer of security on public Wi-Fi.

## Limitations of VPN
- May reduce internet speed due to encryption overhead.
- Free tiers may have limited server options and bandwidth caps.
- Does not protect against malware or phishing without additional tools.
